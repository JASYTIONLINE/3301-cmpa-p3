# Customer Intake Interview Document

## Project Sponsor
- **Name:** Greg Gamel (Instructor, acting as Project Sponsor)
- **Role:** Provides requirements, expectations, and evaluation criteria.

## Project Overview
The sponsor has requested a **proof-of-concept website** for a fictional small business called **This Is Your Song**. The purpose of the site is to demonstrate how customer stories can be transformed into custom, production-ready songs. This project serves as a capstone for CMPA 3301, applying principles of project management, planning, and basic web development.

## Intake Interview Notes

**Q1: What is the purpose of this new project?**  
**A1 (Sponsor):** The purpose is to demonstrate planning and delivery skills by producing a functional website prototype. The project is about more than design; it shows project management, scope control, and professional presentation.

---

**Q2: What kind of website do you expect?**  
**A2 (Sponsor):** A small, rough prototype: exactly two HTML pages styled with basic CSS. The topic is flexible, but the deliverable must be realistic and professional in presentation.

---

**Q3: What outcomes are most important to you?**  
**A3 (Sponsor):** A clear scope statement, well-documented exclusions and priorities, and a working two-page prototype hosted live on GitHub Pages. The final package should include documentation (`scope`, `plan`, `retrospective`) and a README describing the website project.

---

**Q4: What constraints should the team be aware of?**  
**A4 (Sponsor):**  
- **Time:** Final submission due September 21, 2025.  
- **Budget:** No budget; only free tools and course resources.  
- **Technology:** Limited to HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages. No advanced JavaScript, no CMS, no frameworks.

---

**Q5: What should be considered out of scope?**  
**A5 (Sponsor):**  
- Any advanced frameworks or CMS.  
- Any project beyond the required two pages.  
- E-commerce or user account functionality.  
- Overly polished, production-level design.

---

**Q6: How will success be measured?**  
**A6 (Sponsor):** By the grading rubric: completeness of the scope statement, clarity and professionalism of documentation, a working prototype that matches the documented scope, and visible hosting on GitHub Pages.

---

## Key Intake Summary

- **Deliverable:** Two-page HTML/CSS prototype of *This Is Your Song* with a README and supporting docs.  
- **Focus:** Proof-of-concept demonstration, not production deployment.  
- **Scope:** Limited and clearly defined; one jingle demo on Home, four genre variations on Catalog, plus an embedded intake prompt and mailto CTA.  
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.  
- **Evaluation:** Based on rubric adherence, documentation completeness, and functional site delivery.

## Intake Conclusion
This document formalizes the initial discussion between project sponsor and unofficial project manager. It will serve as the **foundation for the Project Plan** and as input to the **Scope Statement** already developed. The sponsor’s intent is clear: keep the site small, demonstrate professional project management discipline, and show proof of concept for **This Is Your Song**.
