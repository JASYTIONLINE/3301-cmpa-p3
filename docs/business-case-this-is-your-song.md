# Business Case — This Is Your Song

## Executive Summary
This business case proposes the development of a proof-of-concept website for *This Is Your Song*, a service that creates custom, production-ready songs based on individual customer stories. The website is intended as a demonstration of the commercial viability of personalized music as a market offering, providing customers with a simple, accessible interface to understand the service and initiate song requests. This project will deliver a two-page website prototype supported by professional project documentation, aligning with both academic requirements and business best practices.

The problem is that there is currently no straightforward way for potential customers to explore such a service online. A professional website is required to validate the idea, demonstrate feasibility, and attract interest or sponsorship.

The project will be managed using PMI-aligned m
