# Project Charter

## Project Title
**This Is Your Song — Proof of Concept Website**

## Project Sponsor
- **Name:** Greg Gamel (Instructor, CMPA 3301)  
- **Role:** Project Sponsor, evaluator, and approver

## Project Manager
- **Name:** John Barkle IV  
- **Role:** Unofficial Project Manager, responsible for planning, scoping, and delivery

---

## Purpose and Justification
The project exists to provide a **proof-of-concept demonstration website** for a fictional company called *This Is Your Song*, which transforms customer stories into custom songs. This deliverable is required as the final capstone assignment for CMPA 3301 and demonstrates the student’s ability to apply project management principles (scope control, planning, accountability) alongside technical skills in basic web development.

The project will serve as:
- A tangible **portfolio piece** showing project planning and execution.
- A demonstration of **basic HTML/CSS proficiency**.
- Evidence of the ability to follow PMI-aligned project management processes in a constrained academic environment.

---

## Objectives
- Develop and deliver a **two-page HTML/CSS website prototype** hosted on GitHub Pages.
- Produce accompanying documentation: **Scope Statement**, **Project Plan**, and **Project Retrospective**.
- Demonstrate effective scope management by clearly defining inclusions, exclusions, and acceptance criteria.
- Deliver the project by **September 21, 2025**, meeting all rubric requirements.

---

## High-Level Requirements
- **Website:** Two HTML pages styled with basic CSS.
  - **Home Page:** Banner, service explanation, one jingle demo, navigation link.
  - **Catalog Page:** Four genre variations of the same song displayed as clickable audio thumbnails, an embedded intake prompt, and a mailto call-to-action.
- **Documentation:** Scope statement, project plan, and retrospective in the `docs/` folder.
- **Hosting:** Website deployed and publicly available on GitHub Pages.
- **Constraints:** Basic HTML/CSS only; no advanced frameworks, CMS, or JavaScript.
- **Evaluation:** Based on completeness, clarity, professionalism, and adherence to scope.

## Milestones

- **Week 8:** Final website prototype completed, retrospective written, and full package submitted.  

---

## Risks
- **Scope Creep:** Adding unnecessary features beyond two pages.  
- **Technical Constraints:** Limited to course-taught HTML/CSS may restrict styling options.  
- **Time Management:** Competing academic/work obligations could delay progress.  

Mitigation: Clear acceptance criteria, scope guardrails, and adherence to deadlines.
