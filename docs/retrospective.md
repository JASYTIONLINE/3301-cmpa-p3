# Project Retrospective — This Is Your Song

## 1. Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to propose a website titled *This Is Your Song*, which included the project proposal, a two-page demo consisting of an index and catalog page, along with all supporting documentation. The project served as a proof of concept that custom-made songs for individuals could be commercially viable.

## 2. Objectives and Results
- **Objective:** The objective was to build a small, functional prototype website meeting the standards outlined in Project 3 for CMPA 3301 — a functional prototype, proof-of-concept, HTML/CSS-generated site, published to GitHub Pages, publicly accessible, with all navigational links and features fully functional.  

- **Planned Deliverables:**  
  - Home page (banner, jingle)  
  - Catalog page (four audio demos, intake prompt, mailto CTA)  
  - Docs folder (scope, plan, retrospective)  
  - README and GitHub Pages deployment  

- **Outcome:**  
  - All deliverables were completed as planned.  
  - Additional supporting documentation was included beyond the minimum requirements: a Project Charter and a Customer Intake Interview, which were used to supply information to the Project Charter and Project Plan.

## 3. What Went Well
The project was fairly straightforward. The Scope Statement was very well detailed, which made it extremely easy to follow and guided the work clearly. Because of this preparation and the previous week’s learning materials, the Project Plan was also easy to create. The Scope Statement received good peer feedback. On the technical side, the HTML work was fairly simple and did not require much effort. Building the site structure was straightforward, and navigation was easy to implement.

## 4. Challenges and Issues
CSS presented more challenges than anticipated. To achieve the correct form, fit, and function, more intensive CSS was required than originally planned. This required additional research to identify appropriate style statements. The process included extensive rounds of debugging to make the website present itself in the desired format. Another challenge was that the scope limitations (HTML/CSS only, no JavaScript or advanced techniques) created hurdles. There were moments where JavaScript would have made things easier, but adapting solely with HTML/CSS forced creative problem solving. In the end, this limitation was valuable — it led to discovering simpler solutions and reinforced core HTML/CSS skills.

## 5. Lessons Learned
The experience showed that scope limitations can be a powerful teaching tool, forcing focus on fundamentals. While it would have been easier to rely on JavaScript, finding solutions in plain HTML and CSS built confidence and skill. On the project management side, there were no significant new insights — but applying project management methodology consistently over eight weeks made this project straightforward from a PM perspective. The repetition of scope definition, planning, and execution reinforced best practices and highlighted the value of consistency.  
It would have been beneficial to include a formal **change management plan**. There were three areas I considered changing, but instead of modifying scope, I worked within constraints to find acceptable solutions. This emphasized the importance of structured change control.

## 6. Recommendations
For myself in future coursework and projects:  
- Pre-read all assignments and examples early.  
- Ask the instructor questions earlier in the week whenever there is confusion, instead of trying to solve everything alone.  
- Use detailed scope and planning documents to simplify execution.  
- Build in time for debugging and rewriting after QA.  
- View constraints as learning opportunities to strengthen fundamentals.  

---

## 7. Definition of Done (Verification)
- The website (Home + Catalog) is live on GitHub Pages.  
- All acceptance criteria from the Scope Statement were satisfied.  
- Documentation (`scope`, `plan`, `retrospective`, plus Charter and Intake Interview) is present in `docs/`.  
- The project passed QA and rewrite session review.  

---

## 8. Success Criteria (Evaluation)
- The project met the criteria for rubric completion.  
- All required documentation was included.  
- The website was tested through multiple navigational paths; all links, features, and functions worked.  
- The project remained within scope: only HTML and CSS were used, and the deliverable was two pages.  
- The website demonstrated proof of concept effectively by showing how a single idea (*I’ll Always Remember*) could be transformed into multiple outputs.  
- The project demonstrated the importance of scope control, even in small projects.

## 9. Closing Statement
This project demonstrates that a single idea can be shaped into multiple distinct outputs, showing potential for commercial viability of custom songs. The process underscored the importance of scope discipline and thorough planning. Extra time spent in planning and scoping resulted in smooth execution and reduced stress. Debugging was more tedious than stressful, but it produced valuable learning. Overall, this project was a successful proof of concept that achieved its objectives, met rubric criteria, and reinforced project management skills in practice.
