# Project Retrospective — This Is Your Song

## Introduction
This retrospective reflects on my process of creating the **Project 03 full proposal package** for CMPA 3301. 
The package included selecting the topic *This Is Your Song*, creating the GitHub repository, drafting and refining 
the Scope and Project Plan documents, building the two-page HTML/CSS prototype, and assembling all required documentation for submission. The reflections below consider both the documentation process and the prototype build, as these together formed the full project proposal deliverable.


## 1. Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create the **Project 03 full proposal package** for CMPA 3301. 
This package centered on proposing a new website concept titled *This Is Your Song*. 
The proposal process included selecting the topic, drafting and refining the Scope Statement, 
building the Project Plan, creating the supporting documentation, and developing a two-page HTML/CSS prototype 
(index and catalog pages) to serve as a proof of concept. Together, these elements formed a complete proposal package 
demonstrating both project management discipline and the potential viability of custom-made songs as a service.

## 2. Objectives and Results
- **Objective:** The objective was to complete the **Project 03 full proposal package** for CMPA 3301. 
The proposal centered on a new website concept titled *This Is Your Song* and required multiple components: 
a well-defined Scope Statement, a Project Plan, a Project Retrospective, supporting documentation, 
and a two-page HTML/CSS prototype to serve as a proof of concept. 
The ultimate goal was not just to create a small website, but to present a comprehensive proposal package 
that could demonstrate both the feasibility of the idea and the project management discipline behind it.  

- **Planned Deliverables:**  
  - Home page (banner, jingle)  
  - Catalog page (four audio demos, intake prompt, mailto CTA)  
  - Docs folder (scope, plan, retrospective)  
  - README and GitHub Pages deployment  

- **Outcome:**  
  - All deliverables were completed as planned.  
  - Additional supporting documentation was included beyond the minimum requirements: 
    a Project Charter and a Customer Intake Interview, which were used to supply information 
    to the Project Charter and Project Plan.

## 3. What Went Well
Utilizing the project management skills I have been practicing throughout this semester went a great distance in making the creation of the proposal fairly simple. In fact, the easiest part of the entire exercise was creating the proposal itself. I began by using the weekly assignments page, the rubric, and the to-do list as the foundation for a notional business case. Since this project originated as a homework assignment, there was no real-world business case, but starting with a customer intake interview was a best practice that I now apply every time I start a project. Even when there is no external customer, I conduct a simulated intake interview to establish the basis for the charter and the project plan. This approach has become non-negotiable for me and, as a learned drill, made building the proposal package much more straightforward. 

The Scope Statement was very well detailed, which made it extremely easy to follow and guided the work clearly. Because of this preparation and the previous week’s learning materials, the Project Plan was also easy to create. The Scope Statement received good peer feedback and did not require any revision. On the technical side, the HTML work was fairly simple and did not require much effort. Building the site structure was straightforward, and navigation was easy to implement.

## 4. Challenges and Issues
One of the biggest challenges came from the online learning environment itself. It can be very difficult to identify and quantify certain requirements when the assignment language is unclear. In this case, some parts of the instructions were ambiguous, and the turnaround time for getting clarification by emailing the instructor slowed production and created stress. At times I worried about heading down the wrong path because I didn’t fully understand the written assignment. In the future, I will take a hard look at improving communication channels, including possibly using the new TTU tutoring interface as a resource when I cannot reach the instructor in a timely manner. The major complication in this project was not the build itself but the difficulty in interpreting expectations within the limits of email communication and delays.

From a technical standpoint, CSS presented more challenges than anticipated. To achieve the correct form, fit, and function, more intensive CSS was required than originally planned. This involved additional research and multiple rounds of debugging to make the website present itself in the desired format. Another challenge was that the scope limitations (HTML/CSS only, no JavaScript or advanced techniques) created hurdles. There were moments where JavaScript would have made things easier, but adapting solely with HTML/CSS forced creative problem solving. In the end, this limitation was valuable because it led to discovering simpler solutions and reinforced core HTML/CSS skills.

## 5. Lessons Learned
The experience showed that scope limitations can be a powerful teaching tool, forcing focus on fundamentals. While it would have been easier to rely on JavaScript, finding solutions in plain HTML and CSS built confidence and skill. On the project management side, there were no significant new insights — but applying project management methodology consistently over eight weeks made this project straightforward from a PM perspective. The repetition of scope definition, planning, and execution reinforced best practices and highlighted the value of consistency.  
It would have been beneficial to include a formal **change management plan**. There were three areas I considered changing, but instead of modifying scope, I worked within constraints to find acceptable solutions. This emphasized the importance of structured change control.

## 6. Recommendations
For myself in future coursework and projects:  
- Pre-read all assignments and examples early.  
- Ask the instructor questions earlier in the week whenever there is confusion, instead of trying to solve everything alone.  
- Use detailed scope and planning documents to simplify execution.  
- Build in time for debugging and rewriting after QA.  
- View constraints as learning opportunities to strengthen fundamentals.

## 7. Definition of Done (Verification)
- All supporting documentation deliverables are completed and submitted to Canvas, the website is built and functional, and deliverables are tested against the rubric and pass.  
- All uploaded submissions are verified as successfully submitted by checking the grade sheet to ensure they are tagged as submitted.  
- Documentation (`scope`, `plan`, `retrospective`, plus Charter and Intake Interview) is present in `docs/`.  
- The project passed QA and rewrite session review.

## 8. Success Criteria (Evaluation)
- The project met the criteria for rubric completion.  
- All required documentation was included.  
- The website was tested through multiple navigational paths; all links, features, and functions worked.  
- The project remained within scope: only HTML and CSS were used, and the deliverable was two pages.  
- The website demonstrated proof of concept effectively by showing how a single idea (*I’ll Always Remember*) could be transformed into multiple outputs.  
- The project demonstrated the importance of scope control, even in small projects.  
- The project proposal was written in a way that is easy for the instructor to understand, making the desired functionality of the website clear.  
- The proposal package justified the need for such a website and demonstrated to a potential customer that the concept is commercially viable.  
- The website and supporting materials were technically correct, and all documentation was properly formatted, grammatically checked, and submitted through the proper technical channels for consideration by the project sponsor.

## 9. Closing Statement
This project was an exercise in creating a business proposal for a technical product — in this case, a website — and reinforced the skills necessary to transform ideas into proposals capable of gaining sponsorship. It highlighted that success in the IT and computing world depends not only on technical ability to write code and build functioning systems, but also on the ability to navigate the business side of the industry. Strong communication skills, clear documentation, and persuasive proposals are essential to having ideas adopted and supported by sponsors.  

The process also reinforced the importance of methodical planning and discipline across all stages of the project lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and control, delivery, and closing. As a student of project management for the past year, I found it striking that the very first class in this computing curriculum emphasized project management. That connection was not lost on me. It was poignant to realize that before diving deeply into technical work, the foundation being laid was in managing projects — a reminder that project management is inseparable from technical execution in the real world.
